<h2 id="5-2-1">Long Term Trend: Extreme Value-based</h2>
<p>This product displays long-term trends (in the form of mixed line and scatter plots) calculated using modified “non-stationary” versions of the GEV and POT analysis11 for each theme and indicator – the annual maxima and extreme event, respectively – for the annual and seasonal series for the entire length of each station record.  Each plot shows the 25, 50 and 100 year trend lines.  The 5 largest observed values in each year are plotted as points. Change rates are given as text. Both plots (GEV and POT-based) are shown on the same page.</p>
