<h2 id="7-1">Monthly Polar Plot: Full POR</h2>
<p>This product is a polar plot based on the entire length of each station record, with the months of the year forming the radii starting with January at the top and rotating clockwise through the calendar.  Each indicator – the monthly maximum (red dots), extreme event (black dots), and average (green dots) – forms a ring of values with the inner two shown as a mix of points and lines, and the outer ring (the maxima) only as points.  The highest observed monthly value is highlighted in blue.</p>
<p>For Strong Winds, the results are further subdivided by quadrant.  Also, a unique plot is created whereby for each indicator all four quadrants are shown on the same plot.</p>
