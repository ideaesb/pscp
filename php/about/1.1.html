<h2 id="1-1">Time Series</h2>
<p>This product depicts, on one plot, the time history of what have been identified as key indicators derived from the elemental observations – the annual maxima (red dots), annual “extreme event”, and the annual mean – for the entire length of each station record.  On the plots the annual mean is shown as the green line, where line breaks are used to identify gaps in the record.  The annual extreme event (black dots) is the average of all such event values for that year and annual maxima are shown as points.  The five highest observed values in the entire record highlighted in blue.  These indicators are plotted for both the annual series and seasonal series.</p>
