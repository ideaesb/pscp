<h2 id="2-1">Cumulative Distribution Function</h2>
<p>This product depicts the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the cumulative distribution function, also known as the empirical CDF, from the time series of hourly wind speed maxima; the 1, 5, and 30 day rainfall totals; the hourly wave height and power maxima; and the hourly maxima of the observed water level elevations and non-tidal residuals elevations. For strong winds, days with no value are excluded from the analysis. For heavy rains, a 1-day rainfall of zero is excluded from the analysis, but for the 5-day and 30-day totals, the zeroes are included. The mean of the time series is shown as a vertical blue line. Extreme threshold values at the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles are shown as yellow, orange, and red lines respectively and correspond with the same color scheme used in Product Type 3. These values (the mean, 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles) are shown in text within the legend. These derived threshold values are used in subsequent analysis.</p>
