<h2 id="7-2">Monthly Polar Plot: Contrasting POR</h2>
<p>In a modified form of this product each indicator forms a polar plot of contrasting  periods of record starting with the recent record and each period shown as distinct rings  (i.e., the 30 year period from 1976 to 2005) and back in 30 year increments (1947 to1976, 1918 to1947, etc.; Appendix A). As with Product Type 5, the period1976 to 2005 is used as it coincides with the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which demonstrated a remarkable shift in 1976.  The nature and extent of this product is a function of the POR for each station.</p>
