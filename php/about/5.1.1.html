<h2 id="5-1-1">Long Term Trend: Regression- full POR</h2>
<p>This product displays long-term trends (in the form of mixed line and scatter plots) calculated using standard linear regression techniques for each theme and indicator – the annual maxima, annual extreme event, and the annual mean – (all on one plot) for the annual and seasonal series for the entire length of each station’s record.  In each plot the trend line is solid if significant at 95% confidence value and dashed if not.  Strict data-inclusion criteria are applied to each annual value, and “valid” values included in the analysis are plotted as filled circles, and “non-valid values” are plotted as open circles.  The top 5 annual values are highlighted in blue.  The calculated change rate is provided in text, along with the plus or minus margin of error and its statistical correlation.</p>
