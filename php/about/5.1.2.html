<h2 id="5-1-2">Long Term Trend: Regression- contrasting POR</h2>
<p>In this product, the long-term trend is calculated using standard linear regression techniques for each theme and indicator â€“ but for the recent record (i.e., the 30 year period from 1976 to 2005) and back in 30 year increments (1947 to1976, 1918 to1947, etc.) such that the plot shows a set of segmented trend lines with different colors representing each epoch. The period of 1976 to 2005 is used as a baseline as it coincides with the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which demonstrated a remarkable shift in 1976.  The nature and extent of this product is a function of the POR for each station. If a 30-year trend cannot be calculated due to gaps, record length, etc. then no trend is computed.</p>
