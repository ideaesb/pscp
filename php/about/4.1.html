<h2 id="4-1">Exceedance Probabilities</h2>
<p>This product displays the exceedance probabilities calculated from standard Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) analysis and from a modified “Peak Over Threshold (POT)” form of extreme value analysis. The GEV is applied to annual maxima data in an approach referred to as the annual maximum method (AMM). The 95% confidence intervals (green lines) on the return are computed using the delta method. In the POT method a high threshold, u, is chosen in which the statistical properties of all exceedances over u and the amounts by which the threshold is exceeded are analyzed. Here, the 95th percentile is used as the “extreme event” threshold. Following Katz et al. (2002) and Mendez et al. (2006), it is assumed that the number of exceedances in a given year follows a Poisson distribution with annual mean νT, where ν is the event rate and T = 1 year, and that the threshold excesses y > 0 are modeled using the Generalized Pareto Distribution. Again, the 95% confidence intervals on the return are computed using the delta method.</p>
<p>Following from above, for the GEV the indicators are the annual wind speed maximum; 1, 5 and 30 day rainfall total annual maxima; the annual wave height and power maxima; and the annual observed elevation and non-tidal residuals elevation water level maxima. For the POT the indicators are the annual wind speed extreme event; 1, 5 and 30 day rainfall total annual extreme events; the annual wave height and power extreme events; and the annual observed elevation and non-tidal residuals elevation water level extreme events.</p>
