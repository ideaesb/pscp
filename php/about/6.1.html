<h2 id="6-1">Daily Time Series</h2>
<p>This product is a stacked line plot, with the daily values for each indicator – the maxima (blue line), extreme event (red line), and mean (green line) – over the POR for each day of the year forming one of three paired lines and where the thin lines is the actual value and the thick line is a smooth value based on a 30-day moving average. The months of the year are shown along the x-axis, starting with May.  The 25-year return period value (estimated from a generalized extreme value analysis) is shown as a solid black line.  The 95% confidence interval on the estimate of the 25-year return period value is shown as dashed black lines.  The top five event maxima are highlighted with the respective year of occurrence.  Linear trends are removed from the station time series.</p>
<p>For High Seas – water levels, a modified form of this plot is created.  It combines the daily extreme event (95th percentile) of the observed water level, the extreme event (95th percentile) of the daily non-tidal residual, the 95th percentile of the daily predicted tide, and the daily average water level on one plot.  Water levels are referenced to mean sea level during the 1990s, a period of high data return for the entire network of sea level stations.</p>
