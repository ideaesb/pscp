<h2 id="8-1">Monthly Frequency Counts</h2>
<p>This product displays (as a histogram) the frequency (as percentage) of the total number of daily occurrences above a set of thresholds by month for the daily wind speed maxima; the 1, 5, and 30 day rainfall totals; the daily wave height and power maxima; and the daily maxima of the observed elevations and non-tidal residuals elevations.  In this case the thresholds used to bin the frequency counts are “relative”, in that they are defined as the number of days in a month in that reach or exceed 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles of the distribution population totaled over the period of record (see Product Type 2 above).  These values (the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles) are shown in text within the legend.</p>
<p>Linear trends are removed from the station time series.</p>
