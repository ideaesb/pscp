<h2 id="3-1-1">Frequency Counts</h2>
<p>This product displays (as stacked histograms or line plots) the frequency (as a percentage) of the total number of daily occurrences above a set of thresholds for the daily wind speed maxima; the 1, 5, and 30 day rainfall totals; the daily wave height and power maxima; and the daily maxima of the observed elevations and non-tidal residuals elevations. In this case the thresholds used to bin the frequency counts are “relative”, in that they are defined as the number of days in each year in the period of record that reach or exceed 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles of the distribution population (see Product Type 2 above). These values (the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles) are shown in text within the legend. Blank spaces (no bars or line breaks) represent gaps in the record.</p>
