<h2 id="9-1">Climate Indices: Paired Time Series</h2>
<p>This product depicts, on one plot, the period of record time history of the monthly anomaly for each indicator – the monthly maximum, extreme event, and average – relative to a common base period mean.  Paired with these indicators are the corresponding time history of several climate indices known to have relevance to the Pacific region (on separate plots). Specifically, these are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the <a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/people/klaus.wolter/MEI/table.html" target="_blank">Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI)</a>;</li>
    <li>the <a href="http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest" target="_blank">Pacific Decadal Oscillation Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)</a>;</li>
    <li>the <a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/jhurrell/indices.data.html#npmon" target="_blank">North Pacific Index (NPI)</a>; and</li>
    <li>the <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/pna.shtml" target="_blank">Pacific-North American (PNA) Pattern</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On the each plot the annual mean is shown as a black line, where line breaks are used to identify gaps in the record.  The annual extreme event and annual maxima are shown as points.  The climate indice is shown as a red line.</p>
