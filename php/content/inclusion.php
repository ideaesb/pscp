    <h1>Inclusion Criteria</h1>

    <div class="content">
    <p>Individual station datasets are selected for subsequent analysis and product development on the basis of their suitability as defined below.</p>
    <h2>Errors.</h2>

    <p>The initial treatment the data are subjected to is an errors analysis. This involves the identification of portions of the time series that may be unsuitable for use.  Typically such errors have already been removed through quality assurance/quality control procedures used in the generation of the raw dataset and details can be found in its accompanying metadata.</p>


<h2>Gaps.</h2>
<p>Once anomalous or missing data has been identified, an objective decision-tool is used to determine what portion of the data will be included in the analysis.  In this regard, three levels of record quality have been identified.</p>

<div style="text-decoration: underline">Level 1</div>
<p>
Only years with at least 80% of the record (i.e., no more than 2 missing months);<br/>
Only months with at least 80% of the days (i.e., no more than 5 missing days) and no more than 3 consecutive missing days <sup>b</sup>; and<br/>
Only days with at least four regularly spaced (i.e., every six hours) hourly observations. <sup>c</sup><br/>
</p>
<div style="text-decoration: underline">Level 2</div>
<p>
Only years with at least 75% of the record (i.e., no more than 3 missing months);<br/>
Only months with at least 75% of the days (i.e., no more than 7 missing days); and<br/>
Only days with at least one observation in every six hour observing interval.<br/>
</p>

<div style="text-decoration: underline">Level 3</div>
<p>
Only years with at least 66% of the record (i.e., no more than 4 missing months);<br/>
Only months with at least 66% of the days (i.e., no more than 10 missing days); and<br/>
Only days with at least four hourly observations.<br/>
</p>

<p>- and in all cases a year must have at least 50% (3 months) of the "winter season" (see below) data.</p>

<h2>Record Length.</h2>
<p>Another decision that needs to be made with respect to continuity pertains to record length and completeness.  For example, it is important to have a time series long enough to contain several extreme events and, depending on the intended analysis, be statistically valid.  Following from above, three levels of record quality are identified</p>

<div style="text-decoration: underline">Period of Record (POR)</div>
<p>
Level 1	Only records at least 30 years in length and at least 80% complete (i.e., no more than 5 missing years) and no more than 3 consecutive missing years.<sup>c</sup><br/>
Level 2	Only records at least 20 years in length and at least 75% complete (i.e., no more than 5 missing years).<br/>
Level 3	Only records at least 15 years in length and at least 66% complete (i.e., no more than 5 missing years).<br/>
</p>

<p>Further, at least two of those years within the POR must appear since 1998; that is, a station does not have to be currently operational but it has to have relatively recent data.  This requirement is intended to ensure that trends or “regime shifts”, which may have occurred more recently in the record, are accounted for.  It applies for what may be described as “aggregate” analyses. If the objective is to capture elements of trends or regime shifts, then a time series of sufficient length to do so is required. “Sufficient length” must be assessed on a station by station, or at least a region-by-region, basis because it is a function of how well – referring to the statistically stability – a trend signal or cycle can be extracted. For example, the most statistically stable climate warming signals are found in the tropics, even though the trend magnitudes are very small, due to the very low inter-annual variability in the tropics. Many time series in the Arctic, however, despite visually clear indications of trend, possess large enough inter-annual variability that the signal is overwhelmed and is thus not statistically significant.  This issue is considered further in the context of a subset of the derived data products outlined below.</p>

<p>Products subsequently developed from records meeting the above quality standards are labeled accordingly (i.e., Level 1, Level 2, Level 3).</p>

<h2>Additional Considerations</h2>
<p>With respect to the inclusion criteria identified above, for the annual series the “analysis year” is defined as the period starting on May 1 of one year and ending on April 30 of the next (with the year of record for the series defined by the starting year) .  For seasonal series, the winter season is defined as the October 1 through April 30 subset of the annual series and the summer season is the May 1 through September 30 subset of the annual series.  This seasonal definition has broad regional applicability.  For example, it serves to distinguish between the wet and dry seasons in the Hawaiian Islands and the cold and warm seasons in Alaska.  Correspondingly, this definition has implications for the types of storms impacting each region during these periods.  For example, winter is the wet season in Hawaii, when cold fronts from the mid-latitudes impact the islands along with Kona storms and upper-level low pressure systems. In contrast, summer is dominated by the Trade winds, and most rainfall is topographically enhanced.</p>

<p>The station datasets selected for analysis based on the criteria described above are subjected to further treatment and analyses prior to derived data product development.  In some instances these analyses are unique to particular themes, and are used to generate other relevant measurements.  For example, wave power is calculated from a combination of the wave height and period time series.  Non-tidal residuals values of water levels are calculated by removing the tidal cycle.  Also depending on the intended analysis, procedures such as de-trending or some form of “normalization” of all measurements irrespective of themes are warranted.  All such additional treatment and analyses procedures are described in the context of the methodology associated with the creation of the various types of derived data products outlined below.</p>


<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p><sup>b</sup>This is consistent with the "3/5" rule established by the World Meteorological Organizations (WMO)as part of their standards for "Climate Normals”.</p>
<p><sup>c</sup>To properly represent a daily average the parameter should be observed at a regular interval throughout the day. For example, it is not uncommon for weather records from small airports to be free from missing data yet not have any nighttime observations – an observing schedule that coincides with the airport hours of operation. Typically these data would not be suitable for representing a proper daily average value. However, if necessary stations with as few a four observations per day can be considered.</p>
