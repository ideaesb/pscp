		<h3>Strong Winds, Heavy Rains &amp; High Seas Theme Teams</h3>
		<h4>Terms of Reference</h4>
		<p>Theme-specific data integration and product development teams are the fundamental working component of the Pacific Storms Project.  It is the creation of a suite of derived data products that is the focus of their work.  </p>
		<p>These theme teams are lead by recognized agency and university-based experts in the area of climate-related processes that govern storminess and its expression as Strong Winds, Heavy Rains, and High Seas in the Pacific region.  The designated theme leads serve as principal investigators in their respective theme areas.  With the assistance of NOAA IDEA staff, they are responsible for overseeing the development of theme area work plans, as well as the coordination and implementation of tasks identified in these work programs.  They also serve as members of the Program Integration Team and the Product Development Team.  </p>
		<p>Theme teams are comprised of individuals with subject knowledge and/or program responsibilities that are willing to support the Pacific Storms project objective of improving our understanding of extreme climatological events within the Pacific region by sharing their experience and expertise.  Typically theme members serve on an ad-hoc basis, contributing input as individuals or in groups upon request.  Team members may also serve as leads on particular tasks identified in the theme area work plans.  As such, they are responsible for overseeing the completion of these tasks.</p>

		<h3>Pacific Storms Project Integration Team</h3>
		<h4>Terms of Reference</h4>
		<p>The Project Integration Team (PIT) is the governing body of the Pacific Storms Project.</p>
		<p>The PIT is comprised of the Strong Winds, Heavy Rains, and High Seas Theme Leads, as well as the Director of the NOAA NESDIS/NCDC IDEA Center and Pacific-based representatives from the NOAA NWS and NOS.</p>
		<p>With the assistance of NOAA IDEA staff, the PIT is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of the Pacific Storms project work plan, including the integration of tasks identified in the theme area work programs.  The PIT is also responsible for informing and engaging agency, institutional, organization partners about Pacific Storms.</p>
		<p>To carry out their work, the PIT convenes informally (via phone conference) on an as needed basis and formally (in-person) on an annual basis. </p>

		<h3>Pacific Storms Project Development Team</h3>
		<h4>Terms of Reference</h4>
		<p>The role of the Pacific Storms Product Development Team (PDT) is to help guide the definition and development of integrated storminess products that can be used by emergency managers, mitigation planners, government agencies and decision-makers in key sectors including water and natural resource management, agriculture and fisheries, transportation and communication, and recreation and tourism.  It is the creation of tailored information products, and the provision of conceptual and technical leadership needed to ensure that information is both useful and accessible, that is the focus of their work.  This includes providing input on Pacific Storms web portal content and format.</p>
		<p>Because of the diversity of knowledge required to fulfill their advisory mission, the PDT is sub-divided into three quasi-independent working groups consisting of the theme leads, representatives from partner agencies, and practicing stakeholders in key use sectors such as emergency management, mitigation planning, resource management, and recreation and tourism among others.</p>
		<p>To carry out their work, the PDT typically convenes informally (via phone conference) as working groups or in small mixed groups on an as needed-basis.  They may also take advantage of opportunities to convene formally (in-person) in conjunction with to previously scheduled meetings, workshops, and other such appropriate venues.</p>
