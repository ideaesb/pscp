			<h2>Gulf of Alaska Lows (SW, HR, HS)</h2>
			<p>Seasonal: Winter (OND or October-March)</p>
			<p>These are baroclinic storms that usually form southwest of the Aleutians, as a frontal wave associated with the thermal gradients (cold northern air and warm southern air) found along the cold-season east coast of Asia, or south of the Aleutians, along the thermal gradients found in the vicinity of the warm <a href="index.php?page=glossary#bwoc">Kuroshio current</a>.  Such a wave may travel a considerable distance eastward before it begins to take shape as a low pressure system. Once the low starts to develop, pressures fall rapidly and the entire low pressure system increases in size.  The low, travelling eastwards, reaches its lowest central pressure over the Gulf of Alaska then turns northeastward toward the northern end of the Alaskan Panhandle.  The frontal system that accompanies the low continues eastward onto the coast, bringing widespread cloud, precipitation, and strong winds. </p>
			<p>This trajectory pattern results in a concentration of storm systems in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) - hence the name.  Because these systems are apt to linger, they are able to maximize precipitation and wind-water energy transfer.  They have the potential to cause direct wind damage along the Alaska south and southeast coast and south into British Columbia.  More often, however, they are major precipitation events with persistent winds that set the stage for the generation of damaging ocean <a href="index.php?page=glossary#sgw">waves</a>.  </p>
			<p>Other causes of storms in the GOA include "imported" <a href="index.php?page=glossary#tc">tropical cyclones</a> and the "cut-off low".  This latter is more frequent in the late-fall - spring season, when the westerlies tend to be situated farther to the south. </p>

			<h2>Coastal Lows (SW, HR, HS)</h2>
			<p>Seasonal: Winter (OND or October-March)</p>
			<p>In the winter the <a href="index.php?page=glossary#al">Aleutian Low</a> intensifies and moves southward.  At the same time, the <a href="index.php?page=glossary#nph">North Pacific High</a> becomes weaker and moves southward.  A circulation of air around these two pressure centers over the ocean brings a prevailing southwesterly and westerly flow of air into the Pacific Northwest.  This air from over the ocean is moist and near the temperature of the water.  Condensation occurs as the air moves inland over the cooler land and rises along the windward slopes of the mountains.  The result is a wet season that begins in October, reaches a peak in winter, then gradually decreases in the spring.  Portions of the Pacific Northwest "rainforest" area receive the heaviest precipitation in the continental United States, with annual ranges on the order pf 100 to 150 inches.</p>
			<p>Coastal lows usually intensify very rapidly just before they move over the coastal waters and can change from a very weak system, or a system that had been in the process of dying, into a severe storm in a matter of hours. Lows which do develop in such a rapid, or "explosive" manner, are referred to by the forecasters as "bombs."   Thus heavy precipitation and winds of gale force occur frequently during the winter season.</p>
			<p>On the coast, very strong winds will occur usually to the east and southeast of the low, just ahead of the associated frontal system.  Often, a second band of strong winds occur behind the cold front in the area to the southwest of the low pressure centre.    The result is that several times each year <a href="index.php?page=glossary#tc">winds of hurricane force</a> strike the coast. Damage is usually confined to power and communication lives, to some crops, and to outdoor signs, and timber.  Very rarely does loss of life or major structural damage to buildings result. </p>
			<p>Once the low moves ashore, it will fill rapidly over the mountains and frequently dissipate before penetrating very far into the interior. On occasion, the low will be able to draw down cold air from the north and maintain its intensity. This results in a strong wind event for the interior.</p>

			<h2>Gap Jets and Planetary Boundary Layer Jets (SW)</h2>
			<p>Seasonal: Winter (OND or October-March)</p>
			<p>When the large-scale flow is suitably oriented winds can be channeled through mountain passes and through gaps in the Aleutian Islands to create highly localized zones of very strong winds that can form a significant hazard to shipping. Another local-scale wind system in Alaska are the low-level "jets", or compact zones of relatively fast-moving air, that form at the top of the well-defined winter boundary layer. Where warmer air aloft meets the deep pool of cold air that is often found over the wintertime interior strong, small-scale jet streaks can occur. </p>

			<h2>Upper Level Troughs and Fronts (HR)</h2>
			<p>Seasonal: Winter (OND or October-March)</p>
			<p>Although the mean upper flow is generally from west to east, there tends to be a series of upper, or high altitude, troughs and ridges embedded within this flow. Upper troughs induce vertical lift in the atmosphere, which in turn is associated with cloud and precipitation. In the winter, these troughs are at their strongest and frequently create broad areas of cloud with widespread precipitation. This process can be further enhanced if an orographic feature lifts the air mass at the same time.</p>
			<p>If an upper trough crosses an area where strong baroclinicity (temperature gradient) exists, it can set off a chain of events that result in the development of a surface low pressure system and/or frontal wave. These will further enhance the cloud and precipitation. Clearing behind an upper trough can be gradual in the winter, but tends to be quite rapid in the summer. Any surface pressure system associated with an upper trough moving eastward across British Columbia often fills (weakens) as the system encounters the mountainous terrain.</p>
			<p>Both the upper trough and the upper ridge interact with the <a href="index.php?page=glossary#nph">North Pacific High</a> and the <a href="index.php?page=glossary#al">Aleutian Low</a>. An upper ridge will strengthen the North Pacific High and weaken the Aleutian Low. This tends to dissipate or divert cloud northwards away from the British Columbia coast and into Alaska, or across the Yukon. An upper trough will cause the Aleutian Low to deepen and the North Pacific High to weaken, so that weather systems will follow a general westerly track over the Gulf of Alaska and into British Columbia.</p>

			<h2>Cold Lows, Summer Troughs and Fronts (HR)</h2>
			<p>Seasonal: Summer (May-September)</p>
			<p>A cold low is a large, nearly circular area of the atmosphere in which temperatures get colder toward the centre of the low, both at the surface and aloft.  These lows are North Pacific storm systems that move southeast into a position where they can impact the coastlines of British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon.</p>
			<p>Once established, these lows rotate a series of cold fronts through the region, producing a widespread area of cool, unstable air, characterized by bands of cloud, showers and thundershowers.  Along the deformation zone to the northeast of the cold low, widespread and prolonged thunderstorm activity or even steady rain can occur for a period of 24 to 48 hours.</p>
			<p>Often, while the original cold low is moving off, the next one is already moving across the Gulf of Alaska on its way to take up a position off the coast.  Eventually, a strong system will approach from the west and will have sufficient strength to force the cold low inland, usually in the form of a strong upper trough.  The vertical lift and upper level cooling produced by the trough will intensify any preexisting instability in the atmosphere, and some of the worst summertime thunderstorms are produced when such a trough moves over a region that has already been destabilized by daytime heating.</p>
			<p>During the summer, fronts tend to approach the coast from the northwest across the Gulf of Alaska. The front may be accompanied by a narrow band of cloud and light rainfall. Southeast winds will tend to increase along the coast just ahead of the front, then shift into the northwest with its passage. As the front continues southward and presses further into the <a href="index.php?page=glossary#nph">North Pacific High</a>, the rain area tends to disappear and the clouds begin to dissipate. The front weakens as it moves inland towards the mountains.</p>
			<p>Cold lows typically occur during the northern hemisphere summer from May through July - the "cold low season", though they can occur any time of the year.</p>

			<h2>El Ni&ntilde;o Conditions, Coupled with Extreme Tides and High Waves (HS)</h2>
			<p>Seasonal: Winter (November-March)</p>
			<p>Inter-annual variations in storminess, specifically so-called <a href="index.php?page=glossary#enso">El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation</a> events have been shown to have a considerable effect upon flooding and erosion along the Pacific Northwest Coast.  El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation events are a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon. El Ni&ntilde;o involves warming of tropical Pacific surface waters from near the International Date Line to the west coast of South America.  This weakens the usually strong SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific, which results in changes in ocean circulation as well as changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation.</p>
			<p>In the northern North Pacific the impacts of so-called ENSO events manifest most strongly during the winter months.  With weakening of the Trade Winds, the warm water that has piled up in the West Pacific during normal conditions is released and migrates east.  Arrival of this sea level 'wave' at the coast plus the more local effects of warmer offshore water and stronger northward-flowing currents results in elevated mean water levels, and correspondingly higher tides.  For example, when the 1997-98 El Ni&ntilde;o reached its maximum development, the monthly-mean water level was raised by about 70 cm above predicted levels.</p>
			<p>There is also a tendency for a southward displacement of storms during an El Ni&ntilde;o winter - they cross the California coast versus crossing directly over the PNW during more normal or La Ni&ntilde;a winter.  A consequence of this is that storm-generated <a href="index.php?page=glossary#sgw">waves</a> reach the Pacific Northwest coast from a more southwesterly quadrant.  Coupled with abnormally high tides these southerly waves transport large quantities of sand, such that there is heavy accumulation on the south sides of headlands and extreme erosion on their north sides.</p>
