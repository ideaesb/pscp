            Coastal storms, and the strong winds, heavy rains, and high seas 
            that accompany them, pose a threat to the lives and livelihoods of 
            the peoples of the Pacific.
        </p>
        <p>
            To reduce their vulnerability to the social, economic, and 
            environmental risks associated with these phenomena, communities and 
            businesses, as well as government agencies and the scientific 
            community, need access to information that enables them to better 
            understand, anticipate, and adapt.

            This site provides access to an integrated suite of products that 
            delineate patterns and trends of storm frequency and intensity - 
            "storminess"- within the Pacific region.  These products will help 
            users to explore how extreme events have been expressed historically 
            and may be expected to be expressed in a changing climate.

        <p>These products are derived from analyses of historical records collected from in-situ stations located throughout the Pacific.  They include the delineation of rates of sea level rise and high water return periods, as well as changes in the frequency of both short-lived intense rainfall events and extended periods of heavy rains and the linkages of these patterns and trends to climate indices.  Such information is critical to scenario development in support of climate change and natural hazards vulnerability assessment.  As such, it is directly applicable to coastal land-use planning and resource management.  It also forms the basis for establishing infrastructure (e.g., roads, water, sewer) design criteria.</p>
        <p>The primary audience for these products is scientists, engineers, and others with a technical background.</p>
